# Midjourney history sync

As of August 2022, Midjourney's multi-downloader did not include exact
prompts, flags, or other metadata. This is my attempt to provide a
stop-gap measure. It downloads any new images (since the last time you
ran it) along with their complete metadata.

**This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line.** See
sync.sh for details.

I cannot provide supportâ€”I don't work for Midjourney and don't even
have access to documentation for their website's (internal) API. It
could break at any time, or do the wrong things because I didn't make
the right guess about the parameters I was seeing in the browser's
network tab.

If you want a supported option, please ask Midjourney.

**2023-02-10**: I've stopped playing with Midjourney and can't commit to
testing any improvements, so I'm archiving the repo. Check the list of
recently updated forks to see if there's a maintained version:
